Spells
Can combine up to 5 elements into a single spell. Any combination where opposites are not in 
conflict can be created.
ie: 5 earth elements makes a very large rock to throw(magically), 4 earth elements and 1 fire element
makes a heavy fireball(more rock damage and effect, less fire damage and afterburn).

Batttle System Ideas

1. Turn based, each character receives several actions per turn. A spell action, 
weapon action, an item action, and a move action(all may be reduced if your spell is large). 

On your spell action you may choose to combine up to 5 elements
If you combine 2 or less elements into a spell:
You receive all actions fully that turn.

If 3 elements are combined:
You lose your item action, all other action are received fully

If 4 elements are combined
You lose your item action and half of your move action.

If 5 elements are combined
You lose your item action, half of your move action and your weapon action

Characters:

Every character possess 5 vital statistics:
Health, Stamina, Strength, Dexterity, and Defense

Characters can equip armor and weapons as well as use potions and items. Players can do things.
